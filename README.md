# Secure-Net

## Introduction
Secure-Net is  a safer alternative system to traditional text-based passwords. Instead of typing in a word or phrase, users create a unique image or sequence of 
images as their password. This makes it much harder for hackers to guess or crack the password using automated software. Additionally, graphical passwords are easier
to remember and more difficult for someone to shoulder surf and steal the password. Lastly, users can create more complex passwords with graphical passwords since the 
the human brain is better at recognizing and remembering images than text.

## Future Scope
- **Virtual reality:** As virtual reality (VR) technology continues to develop, graphical passwords could be adapted to work in immersive VR environments, providing a unique and secure way to authenticate users.
- **Machine learning:** Machine learning algorithms could be used to help users create more secure graphical passwords, by analyzing their preferences and past usage patterns.
- **Multi-factor authentication:** Graphical passwords could be used as part of a multi-factor authentication system, along with other methods such as SMS codes or hardware tokens, to provide an extra layer of security.
